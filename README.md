# A template in Godot 4 for game jams

An empty template for a Full HD games (1920x1080 resolution) with the most common (and boring) things already setup:

* A main menu
* Localization
* Options menu with volume slides, full screen toggle and language selection (persistent on disk between runs)
* Credits screen
* Pause menu
* Music handling between scenes
* Exit button is not shown on web builds
* Basic automatic level detection and load, with multiple world support (so more levels can be added dynamically)

## Screenshots
![Main menu](screenshots/screenshot1.png)
![Localized setting menu](screenshots/screenshot2.png)

## TODO
* Level transitions
* Music fade outs and ins
* Finishing next level selection/completed level logic
* Defeat/Win screen
* Icons
... (more to come!)
